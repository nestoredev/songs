Been through sunshine, been through snow
All the colors of the weather
We've been through high
Every corner of the sky
And still we're holding on together
You got all my love
Whether it rains or pours, I'm all yours
You've got all my love
Whether it rains, it remains
You've got all my love
Until I die
Let me hold you if you cry
Be my one, two, three, forever
'Cause you got all my love
Whether it rains or pours, I'm all yours
You've got all my love
Whether it rains, it remains
You've got all my love
La-la, la-la, la, lay
Whether it rains or pours, I'm all yours
La-la, la-la, la, lay
That's all, all I can say
Ooh, you got all my love
Oh, for now and always, 'til the end of my days
You got all my love
You've got all my love",
